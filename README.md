# impeller_analysis

<p align="justify">
Project that aims to use Machine Learning to find the ideal impeller for an agitated tank. Using decision tree models, the algorithm was able to learn from a small set of initial data and replicate this learning in a much larger input database.
</p>

  - Step 1: Training and testing with a small initial dataset;
  - Step 2: Prediction on a wider input dataset;
  - Step 3: Using desirability functions to determine the optimal impeller.
